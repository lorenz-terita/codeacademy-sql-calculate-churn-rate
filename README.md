The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provide me with a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels.

The dataset provided  contains one SQL table, _subscriptions_. Within the table, there are 4 columns:

id - the subscription id

subscription_start - the start date of the subscription

subscription_end - the end date of the subscription

segment - this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to
